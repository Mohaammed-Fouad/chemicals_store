# 🧪 Chemical Inventory System (Python Practice Project)

This project is a console-based chemical inventory manager written in Python.
It was built as a way to practice and apply Python concepts such as file handling, dictionaries, loops, and user interaction.

## The program allows you to: 
-> Add new compounds to an inventory

-> Update the amount of an existing compound

-> View all stored compounds and their details

-> Save data persistently to a .csv file

## 🚀 Features
-> Persistent storage: Inventory data is saved to Chemical_data.csv

-> Dictionary-based data handling for quick lookups and updates

-> User-friendly console interface for adding, updating, and viewing compounds

-> Tracks program usage count before exiting

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
1) Python (3.x)
2) Built-in libraries: csv, os

## 📂 File Structure
├── Chemical_data.csv   # Stores the chemical inventory (created automatically after first run)

├── chemical_inventory.py   # Main Python script

└── README.md   # Project documentation


## 💡 Example Usage
Welcome to the Chemical Inventory System!

Write an action: Add, Update, View, Exit add

What's the name of the compound? Sodium chloride

Write the amount in grams: 100

Where should I store it? Shelf A

Sodium chloride added successfully!

Write an action: view

Current Inventory:
Sodium chloride: 100 grams, stored at Shelf A

Write an action: Add, Update, View, Exit exit

Thanks for visiting our store!

You have used the system 2 times. Goodbye!

## 📌 Notes

This project is mainly for learning purposes and not intended for real laboratory inventory management.

## Future improvements could include:
-> Editing or removing compounds

-> Better CSV update handling (instead of appending duplicates)

-> GUI-based version
